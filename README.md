# Exploratory Data Analysis of  7+ Million Company Dataset

Exploratory data analysis (EDA for short) is what data analysts do with large sets of data, looking for patterns and summarizing the dataset’s main characteristics beyond what they learn from modeling and hypothesis testing. EDA is a philosophy that allows data analysts to approach a database without assumptions. When a data analyst employs EDA, it’s like they’re asking the data to tell them what they don’t know.
